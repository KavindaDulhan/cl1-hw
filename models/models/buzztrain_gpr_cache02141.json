  "The founder of this movement wrote books titled both \"The Three Fundamental Principles\" and \"The Four Fundamental Principles\". Early in its history, this movement was opposed by Ahmad bin Zayni Dahlan, and its early supporters included Ibn Ghannam and Ibn Bishr. This movement was influenced by the Hanbali school of jurisprudence, as well as the writings of Ibn Taymiyyah. Its foundational text is the Kitab al-Tawhid, or Book of Monotheism, and this movement opposes practices such as the celebration of the prophet's birthday or the veneration of relics or saints. Sometimes considered interchangeable with Salafism, for ten points name this fundamentalist school of Islam that opposes innovation, often associated with the Saud dynasty.": {
