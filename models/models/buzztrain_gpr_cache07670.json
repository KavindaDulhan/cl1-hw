  "One type of these materials has a Hamiltonian that is invariant under time-reversal and Z2 symmetry operations and is characterized by protected surface states that exhibit strong spin-momentum locking. A transition to one type of these materials occurs when poor wavefunction overlap and hence a small hopping term results from the separation of the two Hubbard bands. Those materials are typically transition metal oxides like nickel oxide. They are usually characterized by a very large band gap, which forces electrons to remain in the valence band. These materials, which come in \"topological\" and \"Mott\" types, experience breakdown at high voltages and have high resistivity.

  "The type III version of this protein, which is only found in archaea, uses the substrate generated by the isomerization of a compound obtained dephophorylation of AMP by the deoA protein. It is inhibited by the substrate analog CA1P and may be degraded by the fungal toxin victorin. This protein found in pyrenoids adopts the shape of a square prism, and sees the formation of an enediol intermediate. Its active site contains a magnesium ion bound to a lysine that has been carbamylated by a namesake activase. Its reaction products can act as substrates for phosphoglycerate kinase or glycolate phosphatase. Kranz anatomy is exhibited by organisms that use PEP carboxylase instead of this protein in their mesophyll cells.
