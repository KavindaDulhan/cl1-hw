  "Bennett and Faulkes have published research on this condition in members of the family Bathyergidae. The only crustaceans with this condition are some snapping shrimp of genus Synalpheus. It is partly explained in Hymenoptera with haplodiploidy, meaning that females are more closely related to their sisters than their own offspring, although it is more common in organisms that build nests. Inbreeding causes it in mole rats, and generally, it is characterized by specialized castes of nonreproductive individuals, cooperative broodcare, and a overlap in generations between parents and offspring.
