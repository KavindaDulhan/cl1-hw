Eduard  Hanslick, who was a page-turner for the performance of a two-piano arrangement of this symphony, wrote that  performing its first movement felt like \"being given a beating by two incredibly intelligent people.\" The allegro giocoso  third movement of this symphony, which marked its composer's one use of the triangle, proved to be so popular that there  was no pause between it and the following movement in its composer's lifetime in order to preempt the standing ovations.

  "Two characters in this game go to the world's first operational space launch center to assassinate Nazis seeking refuge in the Soviet Union, resulting in the capture of the protagonist's partner and the loss of that partner's left eye. Its multiplayer mode removed the ability of kill streaks to stack, and replaced the Stinger anti-air missile with the Strela-2. Powerups the player can use in this game include a  SR-71 Blackbird that reveals the direction opponents are facing. At the conclusion of this game's single player mode, the main character is revealed to be a Soviet sleeper agent who intends to release the nerve agent Nova-6 into the United States, and he is hinted by the game to be the man who assassinated John F. Kennedy. For ten points, name this game that features Alex Mason as part of the titular Special Activities Division by Treyarch, the seventh entry in the Call of Duty series.": {
