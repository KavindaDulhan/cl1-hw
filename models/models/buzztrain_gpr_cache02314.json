  "Before one game, this coach choked on a pork chop, prompting opposing fans to throw meat towards the sideline. Some of this man's plays had such names as the \"Taco Bell\" and the \"cheeseburger\" blitz. During one game, he got into a physical altercation with offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride. An earlier gig for this coach was working as defensive line coach for the \"Purple People Eater\" Vikings squads.

  "In one game, this character is given ludicrous objectives such as finding another character's cook book, calling a friend for advice on building a bomb, and searching for missing ingredients for a friend's meth lab.

Besides Blood on the Sands, (*) this person has starred in the 2006 recipient of GameSpot's \"Worst Game Everyone Played\" award.
