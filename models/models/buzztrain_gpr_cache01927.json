That incident happened during the siege of Paros. Earlier in his life, he conquered Lemnos after local Thracian tribes had made this man the tyrant of Chersonese. This man was tried for the Paros expedition and fined 50 talents, but died before he was able to pay that fine. That fine was paid by his son who defeated over 200 Phoenician ships at Eurymedon and was named Cimon. Although originally imprisoned for being a tyrant, this man's involvement in the Ionian Revolt against the Persians allowed him to be elected strategoi in 490BC.
