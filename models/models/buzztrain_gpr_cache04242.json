This principle was utilized to develop a way to enrich uranium, removing the uranium-238 so only uranium-235 remains. To derive it, its namesake used plaster plugs, very fine tubes, and small orifices, thus slowing the process down so it could be studied. When that namesake applied this law to solutions, he found that some apparent solutions were actually particle suspensions which could not pass through a filter. From this observation he coined the term colloid.FTP, name the law that states that the": {
