In \"The Days and the Seasons\" the author questions whether the story of Cimidyue represents the transition from the mythic genre to the novel.  Another section deals with the \"quarrel between the sun and the moon\" in the porcupine redaction in the section \"The Wolfish Appetite.\" This work, unlike the first two sections of the larger work in which it appears, deals with the myths of North American tribes.

This work formulates a \"four-stage\" sequence for the flow of knowledge and one chapter considers the connection between excellences, shame, and the primary good of self-respect. It permits an \"excusable general envy\" in one chapter, while the first chapter discusses the point where principles and judgment meet, called \"reflective equilibrium.\" It introduces the liberty principle and difference principle as part of the title concept \"as fairness,\" though it also introduces the \"original position.\" For 10 points, name this work of moral and political philosophy": {

  "This work describes how Sertorius demonstrated the superiority of wit to brute strength by having two soldiers attempt to pluck horses' tails. The speaker states that Gryllus was wiser than Ulysses because he remained a swine, and insists that nothing is more desirable than being young. The speaker discusses madness caused by manias for building, hunting, and gambling, and observes that Momus was kicked out of heaven for his railery, whereas Flattery is welcomed everywhere. The speaker states that every person carries her image stamped on their countenance, and recounts her upbringing in the Fortunate Islands after being born to Plutus and Youth. The title figure was suckled by Drunkenness and Ignorance, and her followers include Pleasure, Laziness, and Self-Love.

  "This work's cumbersome orchestra led its composer to create three truncated concert suites, whose second section sees a pas de deux bracketed by two pantomimes. A berceuse featuring a bassoon immediately precedes the finale of this work, which notably employs a chromatic descending motif. Various creatures attempt to disrupt the protagonist's courtship of 13 princesses in its (*) \"Dance of the Golden Apples,\" but are later bewitched by the title figure into performing the \"Infernal Dance.\" The title role was famously turned down by Pavlova and taken by Tamara Karasavina to the delight of Diaghilev, who would go on to collaborate with its composer on Petrushka. This Michel Fokine-choreographed work sees a massive egg destroyed by Prince Ivan, defeating Kaschei the immortal. For 10 points, name": {

  "In this work, the protagonist's brother gives up a chance at being a concert violinist in favor of involving himself in the shipping industry. Near the end of this work, the protagonist's son becomes romantically involved with another illegitimate child, Bagga Snebiorg. As the parish priest in Borg, the protagonist accuses his own father of impregnating Pall a Seyru's daughter and marrying his son to her to cover it up. Although this kills Orlygur, it does not do so before the truth arises that the protagonist is the true father of Runa's child, driving his wife mad and causing him to be disowned by his brother Ormarr.

  "In this work, the singer hits a high of B-flat when singing of \"who shall ever tell the sorrow of being on this earth\", and hits that note earlier during the section \"now is the night one blue dew.\"  This work's composer called it a \"lyrical rhapsody\", and early on it mentions how \"the faint swinging bell rises again.\" The harp takes up the theme accompanying the words \"rocking gently\", and the text compares a spark to \"a small malignant spirit set to dog\" a trolley. This work opens with \"It has become that time of evening\" while the calm introduction of this work abruptly ends with an allegro agitato representing a streetcar passing by, but returns to the calmness at the end, when the soprano playing the role of a young child is tucked into bed. Commissioned for Eleanor Steber, for whom the composer later composed the lead in the opera Vanessa, for 10 points, name this work by Samuel Barber based on the prologue of James Agee's A Death in the Family.": {
