  "One orchestral work by this composer opens with a sustained timpani roll and double bass tremolo on a low B, while two harps alternate playing octave F-sharps and G-sharps. Some of this composer's piano works were orchestrated by Andr\u00e9 Caplet. At the opening of one piece by him, an F - A-flat third in the pianist's left hand is answered by the same third an octave above in the right hand. That movement in D-flat major and 9/8 time appears in a piano suite by him that ends with a \"Passepied\". The movement \"Play of the waves\" is the second in a series of three \"symphonic sketches\" by him, depicting the ocean. For 10 points, name this French composer of La mer, whose Suite bergamasque includes the movement \"Clair de Lune\".": {

  "An orchestral version of this musical piece was composed in 1990 by Marius Constant. Its three sections are respectively dedicated to Harold Bauer, Jean Marnold, and Rudolph Ganz. This piece has notably been recorded by Jean-Yves Thibaudet and Arturo Michelangeli, though its first performance was given by the composer's friend Ricardo Vin\u00e9s. The second movement contains a B-flat theme resembling the tolling of bells, after opening by depicting a hanged man who utters a sigh but dies by the end. The third movement opens with three ascending notes and then features a calm section meant to depict the hiding of a dwarf who'd earlier dropped from the ceiling. Its three movements are \"Le Gibet,\" \"Ondine,\" and \"Scarbo,\" all of them based upon poems by the French writer Aloysius Bertrand. Specifically intended by its composer to \u25babe more difficult to play than Islamey, FTP, name this virtuosic composition for solo piano, by Maurice Ravel.": {
