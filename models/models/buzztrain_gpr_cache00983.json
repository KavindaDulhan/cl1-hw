That assassin was dressed in his wife Drusilla's clothes, which eventually leads to their exile. This opera's first act begins with Otone returning home, only to find that his wife having an affair; that scene follows a prologue in which Cupid interrupts an argument between (*) Virtue and Fortune. The lead soprano and the poet Lucan sing and drink together after the philosopher Seneca is forced to commit suicide in this opera, which ends with Ottavia leaving Rome and Nero crowning the titular empress.

Beginning his musical instruction under Schwemmer, his organ works show influence from Froberger and Frescobaldi. His Magnificats served to enhance the vespers at St. Sebaldus, Nuremburg, where he served as organist, and in 1699 he wrote the set of six keyboard arias Hexachordum Apollinis.

  "Compounds which inhibit the action of these enzymes include camptothecin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, and are thought to be powerful anti-neoplastic agents. Their active sites contain catalytic tyrosine residues, and they are responsible for decatenating interlinked chromosomes. These enzymes manage deviations from the ground state linking number which are induced by transcription bubbles and replication forks. In one mechanism for their action, known as strand passage, a double-stranded break is created and a different segment of DNA is passed through the gap. Another mechanism involves nicking a single strand of DNA and swiveling the other strand around the first, in a controlled rotation. These enzymes generally alter a strand's twist and writhe.

  "The conflict centering on this group was ended by a treaty at Meaux, which followed a series of defeats they suffered under Constable Humbert of Beaujeau. Earlier, one of their strongholds at Belcaire had been besieged by Amaury, the son of their opposition's main leader, whose forces are depicted in a famous painting showing them being expelled from the walled city of Carcassonne. The campaign of violence against them was inspired by the assassination of Peter de Castelnau; and while Peter II of Aragon joined Raymond VI of Tolouse in leading their defense, many nobles in the north rallied against them because of Innocent III's promise of claims to their lands. Though Phillip Augustus was too busy with the Bouvines War to join the fight against them, his son Louis VIII did, enlisting the aid of Simon de Montfort.
