  "This philosopher argued that individuality depends on \"haecceitas,\" the ultimate reality of a form, instead of the quantity of matter. He postulated the existence of a being with \"triple primacy,\" which is first in efficient causality, final causality, and pre-eminence, and argued that God's infinity is a qualitative measure of intrinsic perfection rather than a simply quantitative one. He wrote works such as De primo principio, while his Opus Oxoniense, also known as his Ordinatio, was a commentary on Lombard's Sentences that he wrote at Oxford. His namesake school of philosophy opposed the Thomists, who instead followed his predecessor Thomas Aquinas. FTP, name this Scottish scholastic philosopher": {

  "This philosopher's sympathetic review of Gottlob Schulze's polemic Aenesidemus introduced his concept of the \"fact/act,\" or Tathandlung, which he defined in a later work as \"the I posits itself absolutely.\" In his essay \"On the Basis of Our Belief in a Divine Governance of the World,\" he argued that God has no existence apart from the morality of the world, which caused him to be accused of atheism. He responded to those accusations in The Vocation of Man, and gave a series of Addresses to the German Nation in 1808 before returning to the University of Jena.
