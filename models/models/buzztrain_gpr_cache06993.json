You can then multiply each equation by a different length and add them to cancel out the angles. This theorem, named after an 18th Century Scot, gives a relationship between lengths when a single Cevian is drawn. It can be written N times A squared plus M times B squared equals C times the quantity D squared plus M times N.

  "His Seventh Symphony premiered on a double feature with a work that commemorated the Battle of Vittoria, his Wellington's Victory overture. Friedrich Witt was found to be the actual composer of a C Major work originally attributed to this man, the Jena Symphony. He wrote an overture for the Kotzebue play The Ruins of Athens that includes his \"Turkish March\", while his poco moto bagatelle in A minor is called F\u00fcr Elise. His challenging piano works include the Diabelli Variations and the Hammerklavier Sonata, while he originally dedicated his third symphony to a \"Great Man\" and dubbed that work Eroica. For 10 points, identify this composer who adapted the Schiller poem \"Ode to Joy\" in his ninth symphony and composed the Moonlight Sonata.": {
