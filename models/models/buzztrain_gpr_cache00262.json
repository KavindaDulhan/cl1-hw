This figure crowns Socrates with a wreath at the end of one dialogue named for this figure, in which he and Socrates discuss the nature of wisdom, and which also contains the section \"On Prayer.\" In another dialogue named for this figure, Socrates unsuccessfully attempts to persuade this figure that he knows nothing of justice and expediency and ought therefore not dabble in politics. Those two works are known as the \"minor\" and \"major\" dialogues of this figure, and there is an academic debate over whether they can be attributed to Plato.

In one book, this writer attempted to provide solutions to the problems left open by both natural-right and classical social contract theories by introducing the idea of an \"overlapping consensus.\" His last book, The Law of Peoples, applied his methods to the problem of inter-state relations, again grounding these relations on a minimal conception of relational fairness. This mentor of Christine Korsgaard, Thomas Scanlon, and Amartya Sen wrote a work about starting conditions that are based on the idea of a \"reflective equilibrium,\" and was criticized in Anarchy, State, and Utopia by Robert Nozick.

  "One artist from this movement placed a butterfly in front of the pubic region of a title nude figure, on whose hand an owl is perched. In addition to that Portrait of the Dwarf Morgante, this school of painting produced a Deposition scene by Jacopo Pontormo as well as a circular self-portrait with an distorted hand in the foreground, the result of looking into a convex mirror.
