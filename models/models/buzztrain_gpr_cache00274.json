  "One aspect of this god was worshiped in an airtight cylindrical temple, represented all the cardinal directions, and blew the sun and moon into place. In one story, this god slept with his celibate priestess sister, burning himself to death in shame. This god's heart became the morning star, the twin brother of Venus. This god created the fifth cycle of mankind by letting blood flow from his penis into a meal of ground-up bones of previous races. This analogue of Kukulcan and rival of Tezcatlipoca was mistaken for a horse-riding conquistador. For 10 points, name this feathered serpent from Aztec mythology, who was mistaken for Hernan Cortes.": {

  "One aspect of this deity had cylindrical temples that reduced air resistance and was worshipped for igniting the sun. That aspect was the wind god Ehecatl, and the world's largest pyramid, located in Cholula, was dedicated to this god. Another aspect of this god personified the Morning Star, which this god's heart became after he immolated himself from the shame of sleeping with his sister, which he had been tricked into doing by Tezcatlipoca. He created the Fifth Race by grinding bones from Mictlan, and he may have been confused for Cort\u00e9s, which expedited the conquest of Tenochtitlan.
