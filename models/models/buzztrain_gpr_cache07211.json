A musical burlesque by John Brougham parodies it with one person showing up at the \"Tuscarora Finishing School of Emancipated Maidens.\" Critics have noted how this story is similar to an account one participant told of his time among the Turks in Hungary. It is described in the third person in a story featuring \"two great stones\" and \"clubs\" found in the Generall Historie of Virginia.

  "The Stobbe reaction is a modification of this reaction specifically for diethyl succinate, which requires a weaker base to react. In reactions with ethyl esters, ethoxide is used as a base since nucleophilic acyl substitution occurs but will only result in formation of starting material. One equivalent of ethoxide catalyst is commonly added to the reaction mixture to drive the reaction toward the less stable products. This reaction requires the ester starting material to have at least two alpha-hydrogens, to account for the two ionization events that occur.

  "One story about this battle involves a nearby forest of black poplar trees; the losing commander here reportedly struck his sword into a poplar in despair and it turned white. One side was aided by reinforcements under Georg von Frundsberg, whose pikemen surrounded a mercenary group known as the Black Band, while the pikemen of Richard de la Marck were slain. Alfonso d'Avalos, the Marquis of Pescara, led the arquebusiers under the overall command of Charles de Lannoy; he breached the wall of Mirabello around midnight and many combatants drowned in the nearby Ticino River. Its aftermath saw the losing side forced to sign the Treaty of Madrid, which would never be honored.

  "The Stobbe reaction is a modification of this reaction specifically for diethyl succinate, which requires a weaker base to react. In reactions with ethyl esters, ethoxide is used as a base since nucleophilic acyl substitution occurs but will only result in formation of starting material. One equivalent of ethoxide catalyst is commonly added to the reaction mixture to drive the reaction toward the less stable products. This reaction requires the ester starting material to have at least two alpha-hydrogens, to account for the two ionization events that occur.
