  "One of this man's poems, written in a series of rhyming couplets, ends with the lines \"O God, in Thy great mercy, let us nevermore forget; The graves they left behind, the bitter graves\", and was intended as an homage to British victims of the 2nd Boer War. Another poem, written while working as a store clerk in Cowichan Bay, dotes on the melodies of plants and trees and how England shall \"hearken, and she'll understand\". Before moving to the place for which this poet is most famous, he wrote a poem presaging a place where, \"When a man gits on his uppers in a hard-pan sort of town\u2026An' he's in a fix for a lodgin' an' he wanders up an' down\", called The Little Old Log Cabin. Amid recitations of the poetry of others, this poet began to be recognized for such works as The Call of the Wild, thriller novels like The Roughneck, A Tale of Tahiti, and eventually played himself in the movie The Spoilers.": {
