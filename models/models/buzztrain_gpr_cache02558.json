  "Gradient-index ones have a variable spatial distribution of indexes. Metamaterials can be used to create \"super\" ones. These are subject to chromatic and spherical abberation. For thin ones, an approximation exists to the formula named for the maker of one. Converging ones include those that are biconvex. An important feature of them is their focal length.

  "A gradient in this quantity causes inhomogeneous liquids to separate according to the Marangoni effect. When caused by solvent-solute interactions, it is described by an equation named for Gibbs. It is related to radius of curvature and pressure by the Laplace equation, and it can be empirically determined by the drop weight method. This property is decreased by applying surfactants, and it is characterized by stronger cohesive forces. For 10 points, identify this phenomenon which allows insects": {
