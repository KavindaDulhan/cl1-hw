  "While in Rome, this artist accepted a commission to create a portrait of Eva Rohr as Marguerite from Gounod's Faust. This artist's brother depicted Ceres carrying a sickle and a sheaf of wheat, and Thales holding a thunderbolt, in his group The Progress of Railroading. He created a standalone artwork of his favored recurring motif consisting of an angel with raised wings wearing a belt and a crown of passion flowers. This artist honored the memory of a woman who committed suicide by ingesting potassium cyanide, by depicting her seated against a granite block, eyes closed and wearing a (*) robe. This man's sculpture of a president rising from a chair, about to give a speech, is located in Lincoln Park. This artist's best known sculpture is a bronze relief in which an angel flies over a man on horseback leading a regiment of black soldiers carrying bayonets. For 10 points, name this American sculptor of the Adams Memorial and the Standing Lincoln, best known for his monument to Robert Gould Shaw": {

  "In one role, this man's character declares \"Killian, here's your Sub-Zero, now plain zero\", and in another, he grudgingly replaces a sick Phoebe O'Hara, using a ferret to make friends. As Dr. Alex Hesse, he declares \"It's not a tumor!\" and, insulted, asks another character \"Does my body disgust you?\" One of his characters allies with the boss of Bane to save his cryogenically preserved wife, while another must save John Connor. For 10 points, name this star of such movies as The Running Man, Kindergarten Cop, and Junior, who played a futuristic cyborg in the Terminator series.  ": {
