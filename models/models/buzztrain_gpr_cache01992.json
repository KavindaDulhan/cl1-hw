  "One festival of this religion is Kathina, in which common people donate clothing to its holy men. Some of its holy sites are guarded by statues called Nio, which usually take the form of muscular, armed men with angry faces. Chastity, calmness, and quiet are some of the traits included in this religion's concept of sila, or virtuous behavior. Its teachings explain the(*) dukkha, or suffering in the world, through the Four Noble Truths. For 10 points, name this religion with Theravada and Mahayana": {

  "Fernandez and Frenking used energy decomposition analysis to evaluate the strength of this effect in substituted ethanes. The beta silicon effect is one variety of it. Conant and Kistiakowsky observed this effect early on in unsaturated compounds such as 1,3-butadiene, while aside from bent bonds, this effect is the most promising explanation for why some gauche conformations are more stable than anti": {
