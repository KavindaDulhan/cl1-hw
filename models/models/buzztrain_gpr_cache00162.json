  "Alain Chartier denounced an institution founded in this region for naming itself after a pagan object, which was re-identified with an item owned by Gideon. This region got its name from barbarians led by Godomar and Gundobad, the latter of whom issued its namesake law code in the 5th century CE, and it organized the Order of the Golden Fleece. One leader of this region put his brother Charles, duke of Berry, in charge of the League of the Public Weal. This duchy's power faded at Nancy in 1477, when Charles the Bold died in battle against forces of the \"Spider-King,\" Louis XI. At its height, this": {
