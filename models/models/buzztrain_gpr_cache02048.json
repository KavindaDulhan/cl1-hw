From his work on the three forms of phosphoric acid he developed the concept of polybasic acids, devised the method of dialysis, and proved that partial decomposition of certain chemical compounds results from liquid diffusion, but is best known for a law used to separate isotopes stating that the rates at which gases diffuse is inversely proportional to the square roots of their densities.

  "The final tactical withdrawal from this battle was conducted under the direction of John Glover, whose Marbleheaders did not complete the operation by sunrise as planned, but were luckily saved by a heavy fog.  During the previous day, Israel Putnam's force was engaged with Henry Clinton, but a force led by William Howe marched through the lightly-defended Jamaica Pass to turn Putnam's flank, (*)forcing the Americans to fall back.  With over 2,000 casualties, compared to the British 400, Washington ordered a surprise night retreat across the East River to Manhattan.
