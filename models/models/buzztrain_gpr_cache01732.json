  "By the end of this encounter one side's lack of supplies caused all civilians and wounded to be expelled at the base of Mount Auxois where many starved to death. Preceded by a skirmish at Vingeanne, which allowed them to hunker down, the defenders were ordered to dig a trench north-south between the Ose and Oserain rivers along the namesake town. The aggressors responded by digging their own series of trenches and setting up a 12 foot high wall, with observation towers every 130 feet. This technique allowed the Romans to beat back attacks from both sides and trapped the Chief of the Averni and his men in the town. But after capturing Avaricum, Lutetia, and Gergovia, Labienus and his general were feeling confident that the Gauls would fold. FTP identify this 52 B.C. battle which saw Caesar defeat": {

One commander, fresh off his victory at Arcot, secretly negotiated with the other commander's uncle, Mir Jaffar, in order to secure an advantage. When an attack on a French settlement near Murshidabad provoked one side to march into battle, the other had already set up his defenses in a mango grove on the Hooghli River.  Though badly outmanned, a monsoon rain and the judicious use of a tarp to keep the powder dry turned the charge of Siraj-ud-Dawlah's forces into a rout for the British.

The decisive maneuver in this battle occurred when the cavalry of the winning side cut through the infantry middle, isolating an elite infantry corps from its German and Italian allies.

Fought northeast of Reims in a namesake forest, this battle saw 26,000 men under Don Francisco de Melo lose decisively to a French army of 22,000 commanded by the Duke d'Enghien, who would later come to be known as the Prince de Conde.
