  "One model of these devices that reduces to the Ebers-Moll model is the Gummel-Poon model. When the current gain of two of these devices equals the product of the component gains, these devices create a Darlington Pair. The gradual channel approximation is valid for long channel types of the field-effect versions of these devices. One type of these devices may be classified as PNP or NPN, and they possess base, collector, and emitter terminals. Every two years, the number of these devices on an integrated circuit doubles according to Moore's Law. For 10 points, \"bipolar junction\" is a type of what": {
