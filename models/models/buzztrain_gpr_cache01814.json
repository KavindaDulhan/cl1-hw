  "In one essay, this philosopher removed the letters alpha and omega from a passage in the Iliad to illustrate the dependence of reason upon the passions. That essay continues the critique of Johann David Michaelis's style of Biblical criticism which began in this philosopher's Essay on an Academic Question and Cloverleaf of Hellenistic Letters. He critiqued Moses Mendelssohn's Jerusalem in his Golgotha and Scheblimini! and called for a shovel-wielding Muse at the opening of a \"cabbalistic rhapsody\" he titled Aesthetica in Nuce. This philosopher began a noted essay with ironic dedications to Johann Christoph Berens and Immanuel Kant before explaining the title character's profession that he knew he knew nothing as a rejection of the game of reason in favor of analogy.
