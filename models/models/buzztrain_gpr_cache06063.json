This mineral is lipophilic and hydrophobic due to its strong intermolecular bonds, and its distinctively high thermal conductivity makes it desirable in industrial machines such as (*) drills and cutters. They can often be found in kimberlite, and along with graphite, this mineral is an allotrope of carbon.
