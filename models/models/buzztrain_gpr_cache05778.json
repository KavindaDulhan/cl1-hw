  "This man's partisan, Gebhard of Salzburg, was successfully kept away from a meeting targeting this man by his long-time foe, Hugo Candidus. He was elevated to his highest office after a mixed crowd of clergy and laymen began angrily demanding his election during the funeral service of his predecessor, Alexander II. This man's most notable efforts were validated in the century after his death through the First Lateran Council and the Concordat of Worms thanks to the work of Callixtus II. The Synod of Worms condemned this man, whose response led to the appointment of Guibert of Ravenna as Antipope Clement III. Clerical marriage and simony were targeted by this Pope, whose most notable opponent made a long walk to Canossa and groveled in the snow after his excommunication. For 10 points, name this Pope who feuded with Henry IV during the Investiture Controversy, the seventh Pontiff to bear his name.": {

  "Pascal's theorem concerns the figure formed by choosing this many points on a conic section, and this value is the larger number in the first Ruth-Aaron pair. Euler's solution to the Basel problem, which asks for the sum of \"one over n squared\" for all positive integers, was pi squared divided by this quantity. Because this number equals the sum of its proper factors, it is the first (*) perfect number. It is also the third triangular number, and one multiplies side length squared by this integer to find the surface area of a cube.

  "One part of this work states that the fact that the word \"bachelor\" has less than ten letters proves that the word \"bachelor\" cannot always be replaced with \"unmarried man.\" Later, it asks whether a statement \"taken in isolation from its fellows, can admit of confirmation or infirmation at all.\" Previously, this work expresses an inability to evaluate the statement \"everything green is extended\" and says that \"a precise artificial languge with explicit semantical rules\" would not solve the problem. The author of this paper noted that many of its ideas were first expressed by Morton White in an essay about \"an untenable dualism\" from a book about John Dewey. Claiming that \"abandoning\" the title entities will lead to \"a blurring of the supposed boundary between speculative metaphysics and natural science\" as well as more pragmatism, this essay begins by reviewing a distinction made by Kant.": {
