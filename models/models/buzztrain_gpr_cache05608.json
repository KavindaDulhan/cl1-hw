  "This opera was originally planned as an oratorio, as evidenced by a fugue in the opening, after which we hear the aria \"Arretez, o mes freres.\" The composer's notes show inspiration by a woman who'd earlier declined his marriage proposal, Augusta Holmes, though he dedicated the score to Pauline Viardot. The aria \"Printemps qui commence\" signals blossoming of spring and new hope in the first act, while the second act features \"My Heart Opens to Your Voice.\" The librettist Ferdinand Lemaire convinced the composer of its dramatic merit, and six years later that composer followed this work with his opera on Henry VIII. The first act sees the death of Abimelech, the despotic satrap, while the second moves to \u25baa tent in the Valley of Sorek where the key love scene occurs. Ending with the pulling": {

  "This opera was originally planned as an oratorio, as evidenced by a fugue in the opening, after which we hear the aria \"Arretez, o mes freres.\" The composer's notes show inspiration by a woman who'd earlier declined his marriage proposal, Augusta Holmes, though he dedicated the score to Pauline Viardot. The aria \"Printemps qui commence\" signals blossoming of spring and new hope in the first act, while the second act features \"My Heart Opens to Your Voice.\" The librettist Ferdinand Lemaire convinced the composer of its dramatic merit, and six years later that composer followed this work with his opera on Henry VIII. The first act sees the death of Abimelech, the despotic satrap, while the second moves to \u25baa tent in the Valley of Sorek where the key love scene occurs.
