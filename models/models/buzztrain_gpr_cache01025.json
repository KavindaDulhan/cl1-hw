  "One critical feature occasionally exhibited in this property is modeled by the Lifschitz-Kosevich formula, which gives similar results to the Zilberman model. Evolution of this phenomenon is described by a multi-valued current-voltage equation known as the Bean critical state model. Field strengths involved in the upper limit of its occurrence may be calculated using the (*) Eilenberger equations. In addition to the occurrence of de Haas-van Alphen oscillations within Abrikosov Vortex Lattices, it may be identified by the presence of flux pinning, as well as the occurrence of striping, which encourages hole-pairing in a manner similar to BCS theory. It was first confirmed in yttrium barium cuprate, which exhibited a mixed version of the Meissner Effect. FTP, name this property of materials, many of which exhibit perovskite structure, characterized by complete expulsion of magnetic fields at elevated temperatures. ": {
