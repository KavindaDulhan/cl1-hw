  "Similar to von Willebrand disease, its mild \"C\" variety is like Tay-Sachs disease in that it is concentrated in Ashkenazi Jews. The most common version, known as \"classical\" or \"A,\" involves an inversion of the F8 gene; the \"B\" form is associated with mutations in the F9 gene located further up the long arm of the X chromosome. As a result, the F8 and F9 proteins have significantly reduced or no activity, causing platelets to not be held in place at a wound site. For 10 points, name this sex-linked": {

  "Silica aerogels are frequently used in devices for measuring this phenomenon, and one such device is called the threshold detector, while another device used to measure it is called a ring imaging detector. The governing equation can be derived by using Poynting's theorem and applying the Fourier transform to determine the energy loss at infinite distance.
