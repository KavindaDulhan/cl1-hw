The runtime of Dijkstra's algorithm can be improved by using priority queues that implement that kind of this data structure, which is named for Fibonacci. Smoothsort is a variation of an algorithm that runs in O ( n log n ) (read:\"big O of n log n\") time, and has a better worst-case runtime than quicksort, and unlike quicksort, uses only constant auxiliary space. That is its namesake sorting algorithm. In the max version of this data structure, the root node is always the largest. For 10 points, name this tree-based data structure whose namesake property": {
