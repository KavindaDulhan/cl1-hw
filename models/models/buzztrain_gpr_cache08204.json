This novel's narrator, Ditie, marries a Nazi athlete at the outbreak of World War II, and is eventual y thrown into prison by the Soviets who nationalize the hotel he opens  after the war. For 10 points, identify this novel whose title refers to the reply given to the narrator's  question of how he knows what to do by the headwaiter Mr. Skrivanek, a work by Bohumil Hrabal.": {
