  "Dimerizing a solution of this molecule with Raney nickel creates the bidentate ligand bipy [Bee-pee]. One synthesis of this compound condenses acrolein and acetaldehyde, while another method is a modification of the Reppe synthesis using two equivalents of acetylene and a nitrile with a cobalt catalyst. More famous syntheses include one with formaldehyde, two equivalents of acetoacetate, and ammonium acetate. Those reactions are the Bonneman cyclization, the Chichibabin synthesis, and the Hantzsch synthesis. Reacting one of these chemicals with 2,4 dinitrochlorobenzene and a primary amine creates a salt of them in the Zincke reaction. Adding it to a solution of chromium trioxide in dichloromethane creates Collins reagent. A chlorochromate derivative of it is used as a gentle oxidizing agent, and this compound contains a lone pair of electrons lying outside of its ring.
