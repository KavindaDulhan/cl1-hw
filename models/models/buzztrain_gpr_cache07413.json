  "This theory was tested in an experiment in which radioactive iron was placed on a loudspeaker, done by Pound and Rebka. It provided the first explanation for the precession of Mercury's perihelion. A standard textbook on this subject was written by Charles Misner, John Archibald Wheeler, and Kip S. Thorne. One equation in this theory relates the curvature and the stress-energy (*) tensor. One consequence of this theory is that GPS satellites continually need to readjust their clocks. This theory explains gravitational lensing. For 10 points, name this theory that uses the curvature of spacetime to explain gravity, often contrasted with a \"special\" theory also developed by Einstein.": {

  "This theorem was applied to electron emission from a metal surface as an improvement over the Richardson equation. One equation derived from it relates the pressure of a system and the proportion of ionized molecules and is called the Saha equation. Its prediction decreases without bound as temperature becomes sufficiently low, since it holds only when volume is much greater than particle number times the cube of the thermal wavelength. Rearranged to give energy, its first derivative becomes the traditional expression for internal energy. That rearrangement suggests that energy is proportional to the negative two-thirds power of the volume, and in general it allows for energy to be expressed as a function of volume and entropy alone. Its namesake constant is its value at one Kelvin, one amu, and one atmosphere. For 10 points, name this doubly eponymous equation that gives the exact entropy of a monatomic ideal gas.": {

  "This theory replaces the dependence on the external potential, v of r, by a dependence on the density distribution from a straightforward generalization of the Legendre transform from the chemical potential to the number of particles. Considered the successor to the Thomas-Fermi model, this theory grew out of a 1964 paper, which stated that there is a unique relation between the external potential and the ground state electron density and reformulated the variational principle for electron densities. Those results are known as the Hohenberg-Kohn theories.  In this theory, one can use the Kohn-Sham equations to compute the molecular properties using the same algorithms used for Hartree-Fock methods.": {
