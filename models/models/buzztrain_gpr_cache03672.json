In his essay \"Testability and Meaning,\" Rudolf Carnap revised his criteria for how this phenomenon applies to language, which he had put forth in The Logical Structure of the World. Ernest Nagel defined a \"homogeneous\" instance of this phenomenon as one that does not require bridge laws. Eliminative materialism stands in (*) opposition to this type of materialism. Along with the analytic-synthetic distinction, this theory was attacked by Quine in his \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism.\" This phenomenon is often invoked in a derogatory sense, because the end-result does not reflect the complexity of the start; an example is treating the sensation of love as a series of chemical reactions in the brain.

  "John Wheeler proposed a modified thought experiment based on this investigation in which the observer can choose the method of measuring the result, and is called the \"delayed choice\" experiment. A variant of this experiment performed by Shariar Afshar involved a grid of wires placed before a lense, and it was first performed with electrons by Claus Jonnson. Setups in which one of the paths is closed off provides an illustration of Bohr's complementarity principle, and in its original form, light passing through the namesake setup produced a series of interference fringes. It was the first experiment to demonstrate the wave-nature of light. For 10 points, identify this experiment which was performed by a British Egyptologist. ": {
