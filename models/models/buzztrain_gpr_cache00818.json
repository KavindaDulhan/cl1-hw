  "CD19 is an important co-receptor in these cells. They can undergo isotype switching and somatic hypermutation. These cells proliferate in germinal centers, while some of these are relegated to the marginal zone of the spleen. Their activation can be dependently or interdependently of a fellow lymphocyte. They can be divided into memory and (*) plasma cells. They develop in the bone marrow and produce the central component of humoral immunity.
