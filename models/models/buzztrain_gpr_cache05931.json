  "In this play's first act one character gives a speech lamenting people who \"euphemise every flaw\" by calling cripples people that \"do not like to dance,\" before he asks another character to judge a bet over the existence of love. At the beginning of the second act one character compares poets to bakers who are left with the charred remains of overcooked donuts that they cannot sell and must eat. One character is sentenced to be flogged by a hundred different men after getting into an argument with a character that is prevented from raping a girl when her lover picks up his own crossbow to frighten him away. In this drama Mengo is chided by Barrildo and Juan Rojo for interrupting a wedding march by complainging about his horrific tortures, while later Ortuno is murdered off stage by a mob of women including Jacinta and Pascuala. Flores reports to court about the fate of the Commander of Calatrova who scandalously tried to rape Frondoso's fianc\u00e9e Laurencia.
