  "Matveev developed a two-parameter model to predict which type of these objects will form. One model of the formation of these objects has been extended to organic seeds by Pandis, and they may form in response to orographic uplift. One process that occurs in these objects is named for Bergeron. The formation of these objects are studied in K\u00f6hler theory. Ice caps are a type of this object that form over nuclear detonations. These objects may have \"overshooting tops\" that, if they are present continuously, indicate that these objects are part of a supercell. Noctilucent examples may contain thin sodium and iron coats, leading to their unusually high tendency to reflect radar. Large-scale organizations of these entities include actinoform, open-cell, and closed-cell. Nacreous ones sequester nitric acid, altering nitrogen and chlorine cycles and damaging the ozone layer.

  "Matroid theory was introduced to determine when this type of technique is optimal. One example, which makes use of the floor function, can be used to determine the decomposition, if it exists, of any integer into McNugget numbers. The Prim-Jarnik and Kruskal approaches to computing minimum spanning trees are both examples of this type of method. The single-source shortest path problem for a directed graph with non-negative edge weights can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm, an example of this class of algorithms.

  "The MAUD Committee's reports were essential to the beginning of this enterprise, resulting in the creation of a new office by Vannevar Bush. Its Canadian site was situated at Chalk River, and other components of this involved activity at Inyokem, Uravan, and Sylacauga. At the behest of Bush, the Secretary of War replaced Colonel James Marshall with Colonel Leslie Groves, who formally directed this undertaking. However, it was the work of Emilio Segre, Joseph Kennedy, Glenn Seaborg, and Enrico Fermi that allowed for the advancements that would produce the desired product. For ten points, name this": {
