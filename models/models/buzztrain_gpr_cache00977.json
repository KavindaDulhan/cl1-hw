  "The coda to this poem mentions \"the controversy touching the younger and the older Tolstoy, Villon, St. Anthony, Kung, Rimbaud, Buddah and Abraham Lincoln,\" and states, \"In the huge gap between the flash and the thunderstroke spring has come in\". The speaker recalls waiting through rain for four days to see the Jungfrau, and states, \"The deaths I suffered began in the heads around me\". In another section, the speaker claims, \"All women are not Helen ...but have Helen in their hearts\" and describes the addressee as \"a girl so pale and ready to faint that I pitied and wanted to protect you\". The speaker states, \"Having your love I was rich... Thinking to have lost it I am tortured and cannot rest,\" and is cheered to learn that the title flower also grows in hell.
