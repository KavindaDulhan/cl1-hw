  "In the author's preface to this work, he notes that the inspiration for one of the female characters came from Virgil, who had written that a male character in this work had a child by her after being restored to life by Asclepius. In the first act, that male character tells his tutor Theramenes that he wants to look for his father rather than stay in Troezen. Later, Oenone comes to tell that character that the queen is dying of an unknown illness. In Act Two, Aricia learns from Ismene that the title character's stepson is in love with her, but he is later killed in a chariot accident caused by a sea monster.
