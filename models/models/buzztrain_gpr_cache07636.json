  "Twice during this work, one character asks to examine another character's hand.  The second time, a fugitive offers to pay his suspicious rescuer 150,000 piastres to protect him.  In another episode, a funeral and a wedding occur simultaneously, that is, until the \"corpse\" hears the war with the princes is over, at which point he recovers.  Scene 3 sees the protagonist crossing a rotten bridge to reach the Northern Mountains.  There she finds shelter with her brother Lavrenti.  Punctuated throughout by various songs, it was written during its author's stay in California and it focuses on a peasant woman's journey to protect the Governor's abandoned child from the Ironshirts.  The climax is presided over by the unconventional judge, Azdak, who administers the titular test after drawing it on the floor.
