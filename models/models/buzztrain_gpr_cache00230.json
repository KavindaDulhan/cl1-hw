Its presence in founder events, inbreeding, and bottlenecking can produce an increase in additive genetic variance. Analysis of this type using double mutants is employed to develop order-of-function maps for genes that regulate cellular pathways, and it can result in the nonpenetrance of mutant genes such as the gene for Marfan syndrome. Individuals who have a homozygous recessive mutation that blocks the addition of fucose to an H substance precursor fail to express A and B type blood groups and posses the Bombay phenotype, an example of this effect.
