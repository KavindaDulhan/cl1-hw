Fmoc attaches to amine of the next residue, which is activated at the carboxyl end by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). The original strand, now attached to polystyrene beads, attacks the activated carboxyl to form a peptide bond, leaving behind dicyclohexylurea. Deprotection with HF leaves an elongated peptide.

  "One proponent of this philosophy argued that other philosophies failed due to projecting the results of abstractions onto reality. A belief that truth is only a tag that people bestow upon claims in order to present their views was written by Richard Rorty, while another advocate of this philosophy discussed semiosis, or sign action, and the three basic elements that make up objects and their meanings in his work How to Make Our Ideas Clear. That man, [*] C. S. Peirce, founded this philosophy which was later expounded upon by John Dewey.
