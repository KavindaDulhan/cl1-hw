  "The tensor describing this configuration relies on the five spherical harmonics for whom L is equal to two. In the CMB, an anisotropy of this type has poles ninety degrees apart, and the linear polarization of the CMB is a projection of this anisotropy at recombination.

The lowest order gravitational waves would be of this type, and an oscillating one of these radiates power proportional to the sixth power of the frequency. The Hill differential equation is used to model a mass analyzer that uses this configuration, and Wolfgang Paul developed a three-dimensional ion trap with this configuration.
