  "In 1995, a team at Ohio State found that some examples possess a capability called \"homing\", in which RNA transcripts splice them into DNA at the exact spots they are found in other genes. Much debate still rages about the two major theories of their origins, the \"early\" and \"late\" theories. Confined to eukaryotes, they are removed in the cell nucleus by spliceosomes.

  "A team led by Kaganer resolved an apparent contradiction in this by noting the strain on thin films of manganese arsenide on gallium arsenide. A team led by Cistola applied it to the behavior of fatty acids when placed in water, and William Johnson claimed that coherent solids fail to obey it. In 1980, A.I. Rusanov published a list of every generalization of this rule, including those for systems with curved interfaces and systems with chemical reactions.  It states that n plus 2 minus r = f, and it can be syntactically transformed into the polyhedral formula developed by Euler - in this equation, n stands for the number of independent components in the system, f the degrees of freedom, and r the number of phases.
