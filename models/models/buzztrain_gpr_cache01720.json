  "In his eminently amusing essay on this work, Donald Tovey calls its composer \"the whitest liar since Cyrano de Bergerac\" and catalogues the various differences between this work and its source material. Its composer stated that convent bells in this work are \"suggested by two harp-notes doubled by the flutes, oboes and horns\", and in the scherzo, the oboe and piccolo represent pifferi. It used material from its composer's unfinished Rob Roy, while the composer used the money given to him for his later Romeo et Juliette. It features movements like \"Serenade of an Abruzzi mountaineer to his mistress\"": {
