  "If more hydrogen is added to a system of hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas, the system will produce more ammonia to move towards the original amount of hydrogen in the system. If heat is removed from the previous reaction, which is exothermic, the system will react in such a way to produce more heat to compensate for the lost heat.
