  "Lord Fisher resigned over this campaign. Liman von Sanders succeeded in fending off three attempts by Aylmer Hunter-Weston to capture Krithia in this conflict. A last-ditch attempt in this campaign saw Henry de Beauvoir de Lisle and William Birdwood attack Scimitar Hill and Hill 60, respectively. Birdwood was a commander of troops that had a namesake cove during this campaign. Charles Monro replaced Ian Hamilton as head of one side's troops during it. Winston Churchill supported this effort as first lord of the Admiralty. Heavy losses in this campaign were sustained by ANZAC forces, who were held": {

  "A losing force in this battle escaped with only one commander Pedra left alive, and that force retreated to re-equip itself at the court of king Hethum I. Prior to this battle, a group known as the \"100 Princes\" were publicly flogged in front of a crowd - at the same time, four men and a child were sent as envoys to ask for peace, but those messengers were decapitated and their heads were hung on the Bab Zuweila as a warning. The losing force included a group of Cilician troops from Armenia, and was driven back after a helmet-less charge at dusk was made by Qutuz.

  "The losing commander at this battle claimed that had he \"possessed 30,000 artillery rounds\" at it, he would be master of the world. The final day of this battle saw half of Jean Reynier's men defect to the enemy and the other half captured when a bridge was blown up too early. This battle began with General Kleist forcing Marshal Poniatowski to retreat from Markkleeburg, and the artillery on Gallows Hill was not enough to defend Liebertwolkwitz.

  "The losing side in this battle was armed with 18-foot pikes instead of their usual schiltrom spears and the brief training by the Comte d'Aussi was inadequate. In addition, the opposing side outflanked the attacking army by crossing the River Twill at Twizel Bridge, nullifying the superior position of their artillery. Its immediate pretext was the murder of the warden Robert Kerr by John Heron, though it was really a consequence of the alliances drawn up due to the continental War of the League of Cambrai. The English troops were commanded by Thomas Howard, the Earl of Surrey and his opponents included the Earls of Home and Huntley, who led a famous charge. FTP, name this 1513 battle where King": {

  "The losers at this battle were organized into units called \"flags\" with the largest being the \"Dark Green Flag\" led by the son of the losing commander. Prior to this battle the victors had won the battle of Atbara and encamped in the village of Egeiga, and two months after this battle the losing commander would be killed at Umm Diwaykarat. Famous actions in this battle include the deflection of the Green Flag's flanking maneuver by the commander of the 1st Brigade, Hector MacDonald, and the failed charge of the 21st Lancers on the hill of Jebel Surgham. The losing side in this battle is chronicled by I.H. Zulfo's book Karari, though much better known is Churchill's account, The River War.  For": {
