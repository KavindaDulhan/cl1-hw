This novel was published after its author's mother badgered (*) Walker Percy into reading it. Its protagonist corresponds with Myrna Minkoff, adores the Consolation of Philosophy, fails to lead a revolution at the Levy Pants Factory, complains about his \"valve,\" and sells hot dogs, many of which he eats.
