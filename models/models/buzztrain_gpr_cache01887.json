  "This experiment explored a quantity that may be obtained from the isospin plus half the strangeness plus half the baryon number. The friction from spraying from a rubber bulb, through the triboelectric effect, or else the direct use of an x-ray tube, allowed the experimenter to cause motion to reverse after the eponymous entities reached terminal velocity. The buoyant force in this setup is proportional to velocity with coefficient 6 pi nu a. It was an error in nu, the viscosity of the air, that put the original trial two percent off the true value, corrected only by x-ray diffraction studies.

  "This experiment featured an emitting iron-57 nucleus that was placed in a crystal lattice in order to counteract the Mossbauer Effect. That iron sample was placed in a speaker, and the speaker was oscillated with a frequency between 10Hz and 50Hz. The effect in question competes with a Doppler Shift due to Special Relativity, so the experimenters sought to find the point at which the effects cancelled. Performed at Harvard's Jefferson Laboratory, this experiment placed the source near the top of a tower and a scintillation counter near the bottom.

Written after its composer went on a vacation with the baritone Johann Vogl, this work contains a long \"Allegro Vivace\" first movement as well as an \"Andantino\" fourth movement that features variations on a rising sextuplet motif. This piece was written for the wealthy patron Sylvester Paumgartner, who may have suggested its odd instrumentation of substituting one of the usual two violins for a (*) double bass. Paumgartner also recommended that this piece include a set of variations on the composer's earlier lied \"Die Forelle.\" For 10 points, name piano quintet by Franz Schubert that is nicknamed after a fish.": {
