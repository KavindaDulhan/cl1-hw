One of these drugs uses a non-human cytosine deaminase enzyme to transform the inactive form, flucytosine, into the active 5-fluorouracil. Glucan synthesis is inhibited by a class of these drugs called echinocandins. Squalene epoxidase is targeted by some of these drugs, such as naftifine and butenafine. One class of these medications inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase, preventing the production of (*) ergosterol. Multiple double bonds are present in the polyene class of these drugs, including amphotericin B, and other classes of them include imidazoles and triazoles. A drug of this type named": {

  "The extreme nephrotoxicity of one of these drugs is mitigated somewhat by its two FDA-approved liposomal delivery systems. Tubulin is the target of a drug of this type named griseofulvin. One of these drugs uses a non-human cytosine deaminase enzyme to transform the inactive form, flucytosine, into the active 5-fluorouracil. Glucan synthesis is inhibited by a class of these drugs called echinocandins. Squalene epoxidase is targeted by some of these drugs, such as naftifine and butenafine. One class of these medications inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase, preventing the production of (*) ergosterol. Multiple double bonds are present in the polyene class of these drugs, including amphotericin B, and other classes of them include imidazoles and triazoles. A drug of this type named clotrimazole is often topically applied to treat Candida albicans-caused vulvovaginitis. For 10": {
