  "The Treasury Secretary whose advice led to this headline was criticized by Victor Gotbaum as not believing in government beyond police and firefighting, \"and he's not sure about fire.\" That man, William Simon, inspired this headline by advocating an alternative program involving the end of rent control and subsidized tuition as well as a rise in transit fares. Though it accompanied a story by Frank Van Riper about a speech condeming \"insidious spending\" at the National Press Club, this headline was composed by William J. Brink. Its impact led to a three-percent loss in a 41-electoral-vote state, and thus the loss of re-election to the Presidency, for the person attributed within this headline.
