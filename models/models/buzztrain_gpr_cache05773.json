  "One painting of this mythological figure depicts him dressed in orange and green and clutching his breast, and was painted by one of the Le Nain brothers.  A drawing of Saint John the Baptist pointing with his right hand and clutching a staff was painted over to look like this figure; that painting is often attributed to Leonardo.  Raphael died before completing a commission to paint this figure; Titian completed it, depicting him leaping from a (*) cheetah-drawn chariot, holding a pink sheet, and turning the other title figure into a constellation.  Diego Velasquez painted the Triumph of this figure for Philip IV; that painting depicts this god with seven Spanish peasants.  Probably the most famous depiction of him shows him with a half- bared chest next to a basket of fruit and is by the artist of The Calling of Saint Matthew.

  "One painting of this mythological figure depicts him dressed in orange and green and clutching his breast, and was painted by one of the Le Nain brothers.  A drawing of Saint John the Baptist pointing with his right hand and clutching a staff was painted over to look like this figure; that painting is often attributed to Leonardo.  Raphael died before completing a commission to paint this figure; Titian completed it, depicting him leaping from a (*) cheetah-drawn chariot, holding a pink sheet, and turning the other title figure into a constellation.  Diego Velasquez painted the Triumph of this figure for Philip IV; that painting depicts this god with seven Spanish peasants.

  "A painting attributed to Hans Eworth depicts Elizabeth I in a version of this scene. Charles Bell's photorealistic version of it shows some of the figures in translucent clothing wearing sashes and holding a key and a rose. Another version has the central figure in medieval armor sitting a against a tree in the center, while a red-winged figure emerges out of a dark cloud holding a bow. That depiction is by Cranach the Elder, and many depictions of this scene show a peacock standing behind one of the subjects. Another version has Alecto in a cloud clutching her head above the scene while a man with a winged hat hides behind a tree on the right, and depicts the figures on the left in various states of undress, the central one wrapping a red cloth around her backside. One of those nude figures is believed to be Helene Fourment, who looks at a golden apple held by the central male.
