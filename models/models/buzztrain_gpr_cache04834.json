Leaders of this movement included Theodorus Frelinghuysen, who inspired the founders of Log College, William and Gilbert Tennent. One opponent of this movement was Charles Chauncy, and it saw the first use of the terms \"Old Lights\" and \"New Lights.\" One speech given in support of this period spoke of \"great waters that are dammed for the present\" and an \"arrow made ready on the string,\" and opens with the quote \"Their foot shall slide in due time.\" One figure associated with this movement led a congregation at Northampton, while another was George Whitefield.
