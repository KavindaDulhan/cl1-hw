  "The narrator of a story by this author panics after waking up and finding one of his slippers missing; earlier; that character sees a raincoat on a sofa shortly before receiving a call telling him that his brother-in-law has been hit by a train. A character created by this man is criticized for his vanity so much that he is relieved to awaken one morning and find that his nose hangs five inches beyond his chin. A hallucination-plagued man narrates this author's story (*) \"Cogwheels.\" This non-Gogol author of \"The Nose\" wrote a story in which the body of a woman who sold snake meat as fish has its hair stolen by an old woman, who in turn is robbed by a servant. The setting of that story, a gate, was combined with the plot of a story by this man presenting four different viewpoints of a murder to create a Kurosawa film.

He discusses the merits of equality with a Gypsy-king with whom he takes shelter for the night, learns how a gambling problem and the betrayal of Watson lead to the destitution of the Man of the Hill, and gives three guineas to a novice highwayman who fails to rob him. He discovers the highwayman is Mrs. Miller's cousin when he arrives in London, where he is nearly executed for stabbing Mr. Fitzpatrick while avoiding the affections of Lady Bellaston. He is also helped by his one-time lover Mrs. Waters, who is briefly thought to be his mother before Squire Allworthy sorts things out.

  "The narrator of one of this man's works is an heir to a pork company who believes he is Georg Buchner, while another work sees author Wolfgang Schwitter come back from the dead twice.
