Riechenbach sorted this method into four different types, including a \"cross\" variety, and set forth the \"straight rule\" of it. Sandy Zebell generalized a continuum of these methods devised by Johnson and Carnap, and Carnap himself divided it into direct inference, predictive inference, and three other methods.
