  "Gerhard Ertl won his Nobel Prize in 2007 in part due to his work on the mechanism of this process. Potassium hydroxide acts as a catalytic promoter of this process. The biological version of this process is facilitated by molybdenum-based enzymes. The product of this reaction is usually removed to drive the reaction to the right in a famous application of Le Chatlier's Principle. An iron oxide catalyst is used in this industrial process, the product of which is also synthesized by rhizobia. The Ostwald process converts this process's product into nitric acid.
