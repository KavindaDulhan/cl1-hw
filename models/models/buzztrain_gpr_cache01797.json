  "Ernst Kummer showed that non-unique factorization produced a fatal flaw in the work of Cauchy and Lam?that could not be overcome for certain irregular primes. Gerhard Frey showed this problem's equivalence to the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, which Ken Ribet proved in 1986, while three years earlier, Gerd Faltings showed it has a finite number of relatively prime solutions for n greater than or equal to 3.  Finally, in 1995 Andrew Wiles proved, for ten points, what conjecture that there are no non-trivial": {
