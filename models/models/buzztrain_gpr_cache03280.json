The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars organizes an \"International History Project\" of this event, which is notably studied by the likes of James Hershberg, Nigel Ashton, and Melvyn Leffler.

Odd Arne Westad argued for a focus on the Third World in his \"Global\" history of it. We Now Know titled a 1997 essay on this conflict by the Yale professor most famous for studying it.

It criticizes the inability of monetary policy to have any influence on wage-price interactions in a chapter called \"The Monetary Illusion,\" while chapter 11 of this work criticizes consumer wants which arise from \"the process of satisfying wants\" and calls it the \"dependence effect.\" Another chapter criticizes the use of GDP and GNP as a measure of quality of life and is titled \"The Paramount Position of Production.\" Its author originally titled it \"Why the Poor are Poor\" and discarded another title which described the central entity as \"opulent\" and its second chapter contains an attack on a concept which espouses \"predictability\" over \"originality\" and preaches \"what the audience most wants to hear,\" conventional wisdom.

That reaction differs from the others in that it can only be catalyzed by an alkoxide base, and applies to esters, while another type of this reaction is typified by the reaction of enolate ions with carbonyl compounds, followed by dehydration.
