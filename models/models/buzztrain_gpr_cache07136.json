  "Solutions to this equation for a periodic system can be combined according Bloch's theorem. One method of solving this equation for an N-body system is to select a trial function and then use the variational principle in order to iterate the choice. Another method to solve this equation decomposes a Hamiltonian into a zeroth-order part and adds a quantity V, which is the perturbation theory named for Rayleigh and this equation's namesake. Solvable with the Hartree- Fock method, it can be written as E psi equals H psi in its time-independent formulation, and solving this equation for the hydrogen atom gives orbitals.

This quantity is found by summing the inverse of each individual value when their associated devices are connected in series, while it is summed directly when the devices are in parallel. An early device associated with this quantity is the Leyden jar. This quantity is more commonly found by dividing charge by voltage for a namesake parallel-plate device.
