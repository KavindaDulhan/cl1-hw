Du Bois's call for manuscripts for the 1926 Krigwa literary contest emphasized that he disagreed with this phrase and wanted the submissions to ignore it because he was \"primarily interested in the earth\"; Du Bois's stance on this phrase earned him a reputation as a propagandist during a feud with Claude McKay. Stefan George translated this phrase into German and used it as the motto for his magazine Bla\u0308tter.

This work was written 30 years after its composer wrote a similar work in A major, which wasn't orchestrated until Gunter Raphael found it in the 1920s. The second movement of this work draws on the song \"Leave me alone,\" a favorite piece of the composer's sick sister-in-law, who died and was commemorated in the quotation of \"The Cypresses\" in the last movement.

  "In the first movement of Handel's Organ Concerto in B-Flat Major, Opus 7, No. 1, two of these instruments play the theme from Handel's G-minor keyboard passacaglia. Handel's only non-organ solo concertos are three for this instrument. At the beginning of \"He Gave Them Hailstones\" from Handel's Israel in Egypt, these instruments alternate with the strings. The second movement of Handel's Water Music is a solo for this instrument. Two of them in unison play a plainchant tune in the \"Suscepit Israel\" from Bach's Magnificat. In \"The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba\" from Handel's Solomon, busy tutti passages alternate with passages for two of these instruments. Three of them play the baseline in the second trio from Bach's first Brandenburg Concerto. Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks calls for 24 of them.

  "The first utterance of this phrase occurred in a conversation contrasting the beliefs of Schelling and Schiller between Henry Crabb Robinson and Benjamin Constant. W.E.B. Du Bois's call for manuscripts for the 1926 Krigwa literary contest emphasized that he disagreed with this phrase and wanted the submissions to ignore it because he was \"primarily interested in the earth\"; Du Bois's stance on this phrase earned him a reputation as a propagandist during a feud with Claude McKay. Stefan George translated this phrase into German and used it as the motto for his magazine Bla\u0308tter. The banner above the MGM lion contains a Latin rendering of this phrase, which was first used in English in Swinburne's poem William Blake and a review of William Morris's poetry by Walter Pater.
