That form sees a laser fire a beam at the matrix, after which the sample vaporizes and picks up a proton. In another form, the analytes are passed through volatile compounds like acetonitrile, and a high voltage causes the solution to form fine droplets.

  "One form of this law is equivalent to Newton's theorem of universal gravitation and allows for calculation of the gravitational field. Since gravity is a conservative force with zero curl, as are the other forces this law deals with, the differential form of this law simply becomes Poisson's equation, allowing for the calculation of both potential and field. Applications of this law usually involve constructing one of its namesake surfaces around a model object (such as a Bouguer plate) through which flux is measured. A more commonly seen form of this law can be derived from Coulomb's law through integration and application of the Dirac delta function, and its differential form states that the": {

  "In the foreground of one of this man's paintings, a brown-clad monk reaches forward with a goblet to meet a number of swords. That painting by this man, his largest canvas ever, unexpectedly places a two-tiered blue-and-gold crown on a one-eyed Batavian and was systematically sliced apart in a desperate attempt to sell the fragments. In another of his paintings, an older beret-wearing figure peeks out from behind a curtain to gaze at the title figure, who lies in bed as a golden infant with an anguished expression flies above her. This artist of The (*) Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis and that depiction of Danae painted a work centered on a skullcapped man, who stands in an alcove behind a quintet of hat-wearing men who examine a logbook. Another painting by this artist of Syndics of the Clothmakers' Guild depicts a shadowy dog menacing a drummer on the right, while an illuminated, ethereal girl holds a chicken next to a red-clad man holding a musket.
