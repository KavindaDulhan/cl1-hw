Those books had little in common with this man's later writings, such as The Evolution of Worlds and The Genesis of the Planets.  In his major scientific project, this man competed with the discoverer of Saturn's moon Phoebe, William Pickering.  This man's work built on observations made by Richard Proctor, and agreed with the assumptions of Nicolas Flammarion and the director of the Brera Observatory in Milan.  Harold Spencer Jones later offered an explanation of this man's observations by showing that smudges at the edge of vision appear to be connected straight lines.  He correctly guessed the existence of a \"Planet X\" beyond Neptune, but was less successful in his observations of a planet closer to Earth.
