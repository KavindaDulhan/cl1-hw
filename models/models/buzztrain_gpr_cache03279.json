The Novelty algorithm is a heuristic method for solving it, using historical information to change the values of variables that haven't recently been changed on successive iterations. The Davis-Putnam procedure for solving this problem requires exponential space in the general case. A refined algorithm by Davis, Logemann, and Loveland, known as DPLL, is often employed to solve it in automated theorem provers. A variant of this problem, in which the clauses of the sentence are in conjunctive normal form and each contain three literals, can be polynomial time reduced to the clique problem by constructing a graph in which each node represents \u25baa Boolean variable.
