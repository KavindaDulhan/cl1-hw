The title role was created by the French poet Theophile Gautier for Carolotta Grisi, although it was out of the repertoire until Daighilev brought it back in 1910. In act 1, the title character falls in love with a prince after he comes to town with his family disguised as a peasant, but he is fought by Hilarion, a hunter that loves the title character. The title character dies at the end of act 1, and in act 2 she becomes one of the Willies, who try to kill her lover Albrecht to avenge her death, but her love for him saves his life. FTP name": {

This device is called a channeltron. In more conventional forms, hemispherical electron energy analyzers are used to measure the kinetic energy of incoming electrons. Pioneered by Siegbahn in 1954 for which he received the Nobel prize in 1981, this analytical technique measures kinetic energies and the intensity of electrons escaping from the first 1-10 micrometers of a surface.

This device is called a channeltron. In more conventional forms, hemispherical electron energy analyzers are used to measure the kinetic energy of incoming electrons. Pioneered by Siegbahn in 1954 for which he received the Nobel prize in 1981, this analytical technique measures kinetic energies and the intensity of electrons escaping from the first 1-10 micrometers of a surface. In this method electron binding energies are calculated by subtracting the measured electron kinetic energies and known work functions from energies of photons generally obtained from synchrotron sources.
