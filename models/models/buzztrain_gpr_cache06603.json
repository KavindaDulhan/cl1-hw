That song also uses Wynton Kelly on piano, rather than the pianist who plays all the other tracks on this album, Bill Evans. This album, which contains a track with an unusual bass vamp entitled All Blues, also contains a track which switches between three modes using the 13th of the leading chord, entitled Blue in Green.

The proposer of a form of the ergodic hypothesis relating to electrolysis, this physicist derived the aforementioned relation by applying that form to electrolytic dissociation.

An equation sometimes called his theorem states that the integral of the inexact heat differential divided by the temperature vanishes over a reversible cycle; a better-known statement due to him notes that the same integral is non-negative over a general thermodynamic cycle.
