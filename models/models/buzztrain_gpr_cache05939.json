  "A plot of current from this phenomenon against potential difference yields curves at different intensities that converge to a stopping potential at some negative applied voltage, measuring the energy of the fastest electron. Since no detectable time lag has ever been measured and the kinetic energy is independent of light intensity, the explanation for this effect must rely on a characteristic cutoff frequency, the product of which with Planck's constant equals the work function, the minimum energy needed by an electron to escape the forces that bind it to a metal surface.

  "A plot whereby these people were paid by Jews and the King of Granada to poison wells with reptile parts and excrement was discovered by the bishop of Pamiers in 1321, prompting a general massacre. Prompted by the rediscovery of these people in India and the \"Imperial Danger\" scare, George Thin wrote an influential book about them.
