  "A factory whistle opens a thirteen-voice chorus in the first work of this type by this composer. A triumphant march in the first movement of another of these works by this composer uses low strings, a bassoon, and a bass drum and picks up from a theme about a small girl that consists of a bass solo with celesta accompaniment. The third movement of that work of this type by this composer uses strophic variations and represents the sighs of tired women in a market with string glissandi. Eight lines": {
