  "The frequency spectrum of this phenomenon is proportional to the integral from frequency over cut-off frequency to infinity of the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order five-thirds. The total power generated by this process is proportional to to the electron charge squared time the sixth power of the Lorenz factor; in the non-relativistic limit, that power is proportional times the square of the acceleration. Those limits respectively give the Lienard and (*) Larmor formulas. Wigglers are designed to produce this phenomenon by creating a periodic vector potential in a beam path. The classical limit of this behavior for circular causal motion is cyclotron radiation. For 10 points, identify this phenomenon, the production of radiation by relativistic charges accelerated by a magnetic field.": {
