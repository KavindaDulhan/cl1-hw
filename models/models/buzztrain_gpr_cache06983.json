Later in that same chapter its author discusses the concept of life in Count Yorck. In its third part, the author argues that humans are in the world through being in language. The author takes his epigraph from Rilke, which leads into the first part's discussion of aesthetics and Kant's Critique of Judgment. Taking a concept from Book VI of Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics, this work asserted the primacy of phronesis and dialogue in human understanding. FTP, identify": {

  "Before the second conflict of this name was fought, the aggressor unsuccessfully offered to repeal Ship Money in exchange for support.  An army consisting mainly of \"trained bands\" of soldiers retreated in the face of Covenanting forces in the first conflict of this name, while the second one saw an invading army march pass defenses on the River Tweed and win a famous victory thanks to General Leslie at another battle.  The first one was ended by the Pacification of Berwick which contained an agreement that the Episcopacy would be abolished, and a later peace settlement was reached by the Treaty of Ripon.  One of the most famous battles fought during these conflicts was the Battle of Newburn.  Because they would not give the monarch the funds he desired to fight the second one, the Short Parliament was dissolved, but a lack of military success resulted in the calling of the Long Parliament.

  "Before the second conflict of this name was fought, the aggressor unsuccessfully offered to repeal Ship Money in exchange for support.  An army consisting mainly of \"trained bands\" of soldiers retreated in the face of Covenanting forces in the first conflict of this name, while the second one saw an invading army march pass defenses on the River Tweed and win a famous victory thanks to General Leslie at another battle.  The first one was ended by the Pacification of Berwick which contained an agreement that the Episcopacy would be abolished, and a later peace settlement was reached by the Treaty of Ripon.  One of the most famous battles fought during these conflicts was the Battle of Newburn.  Because they would not give the monarch the funds he desired to fight the second one, the Short Parliament was dissolved, but a lack of military success resulted in the calling of the Long Parliament.
