Part 2 includes the lullaby \"Softly and Gently\" as sung by a chorus of angels, while the whole work begins with an orchestral prelude that segues into the title figure's first words: \"Jesu, Maria.\"  Originally composed for the Birmingham music festival, it depicts the title man's journey from death to his encounter with God in Heaven.
