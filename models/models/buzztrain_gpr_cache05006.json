This phenomenon was used by a satellite locked to IM Pegasi, Gravity Probe B, to test general relativity. A relativistic correction named for it results from the noncommutativity of nonaligned Lorentz transforms and reduces the spin-orbit interaction by a factor of two. A discrepancy in this phenomenon for the perihelion of Mercury was resolved by general relativity. It is experienced by a magnetic moment in an external magnetic field in an effect named for Larmor.
