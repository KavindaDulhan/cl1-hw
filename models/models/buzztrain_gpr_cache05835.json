  "PENCIL AND PAPER READY.  Yi Sun wants to calculate how to make computational questions compatible with good quizbowl.  He starts by making 13 posts in the \"An Open Letter to NAQT\" thread about the Alexander-Leftchetz duality, but loses 40% of his argument's validity by agreeing with Brad Fischer.  Reaching a dead end, he convinces Tom Egan to make X7 edits to the Computational Math page on the qbwiki, where x represents the O'Neals Handwave index calculated to the nearest Watson Ladd integral.  Still not finding a satisfactory answer, Yi studies the 30 canonical types of NAQT math problems for 6 hours, applying a Fourier Transform to the 425 character limit, printing out the result, and accidentally using the paper in place of a substituted alkene while performing a Diels-Alder reaction for his orgo class.  The subsequent explosion kills him so he is not able to finish the problem.  For no points, give a funeral oration which explains for Yi why computational math questions make good quizbowl.": {
