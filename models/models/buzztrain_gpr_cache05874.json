  "One of these phenomena was discovered by Jean Antoine Nollet using a pig bladder, and they can be used in determining molecular weight if the chemical potential of all phases is the same. One law concerning one of these phenomena only applies to mixtures where fugacity can be replaced by simple pressures, which are termed ideal mixtures. That example of these properties is dependent on mole fraction as described by Raoult's law. Aside from vapor pressure, these properties involve the use of the van't Hoff factor. For 10 points, name these concentration-dependent properties of mixtures which include boiling point elevation and freezing point depression.": {
