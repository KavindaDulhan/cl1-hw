  "An accidental crash that killed 23 members of the 56th SPS marked its first set of casualties.

  "Acceptors produce a \"yes or no\" answer in response to an input, Recognizers categorize the input, and Transducers generate an output from a given input. The deterministic type consists of an alphabet, a 2  set of \"positions,\" and a transition function, and imposes the condition that at every position there is at most one transition for each possible input. The nondeterministic type replaces the transition function with a more general relation, thus enabling the automaton to have more than one transition for a given input.  FTP, identify this general type of automaton which takes its name from the": {
