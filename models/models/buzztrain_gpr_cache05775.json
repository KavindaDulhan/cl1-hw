  "PAME is a syndrome caused by one of these organisms, which is known as Naegleria fowleri. In addition to a \"brain eating\" species, another species can cause keratitis and encephalitis, while the species Histolytica causes a namesake dysentery. Its largest species, Pelomyxa palustris, inhabits oxygen-poor mud at the bottom of ponds. These members of phylum Rhizopoda contain actin extensions known as pseudopodia.
