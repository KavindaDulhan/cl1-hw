  "The giantess Eriphilia appears riding on a wolf in canto 7 of this work, only to be slain by the protagonist. He escapes using a ring provided by Melissa, and rides off to Ebuda, where a maiden is chained to a rock after escaping from Sacripant, king of Circassia. After his brother Cloridan is killed by Zerbino of Scotland, Medoro is nursed back to health and taken to Cathay, leaving only his lover's bracelet behind. Mourning over the death of Zerbino in the hands of Mandricardo, Isabella is killed by the drunk Rodomonte of Algiers, who, consumed by regret, challenges passers-by at a bridge. Astolfo retrieves the sensibility of the titular hero, while Ruggiero ends up with Bradamante. For ten": {
