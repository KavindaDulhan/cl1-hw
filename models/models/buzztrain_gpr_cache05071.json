  "In the New Chronicles  by Giovanni Villani, he suggests that this was built on the site of a temple to Mars, but it is likely only a Roman guard tower. In its present form it was constructed around 1029, a Romanesque structure in the shape of an octagon. Its ceiling is a vast mosaic depicting the Last Judgement and it contains the tomb of Antipope John XXIII by Donatello. The south doors, completed in 1326, were the work of Andrea Pisano, while 48 years were taken to complete the east and north doors after the artist beat out Filippo Brunelleschi and others for the commission.
