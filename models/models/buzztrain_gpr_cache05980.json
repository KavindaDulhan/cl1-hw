  "At one point, this work notes that you are a breath in God's Sphere and a leaf in God's forest. One of this book's commands is to say \"I have found a truth\" instead of \"I have found the truth,\" and it also asks \"who shall command the skylark not to sing?\" Beauty is presented as \"eternity gazing at itself in the mirror,\" which is heard shouting among the mountains by the restless. It describes evil as good tortured by hunger and thirst, pleasure as a freedom song and ends by affirming \"There are no graves here.\" Beginning with \"The Coming of the Ship,\" this work ends with Almitra the seeress blessing the day and thanking the title figure before leaving Orphalese.
