  "The Dominican bachata may derive from this genre.   Songwriters in the duple meter Latin American version of this genre include Rafael Hernandez, Pedro Flores, and Jose Pepe Sanchez, whose \"Tristezas\" is sometimes considered the first song in this genre.  Works in the triple meter European version include Chopin's Opus 19 in C Major and a piece in which the snare drum plays the exact same thing for fifteen minutes.
