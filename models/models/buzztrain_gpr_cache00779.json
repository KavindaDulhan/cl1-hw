That opinion also uses the examples of wharfingers and hackney-coachmen and quotes Lord Hale's De Portibus Maris to show that the legislation in question did not violate the due process clause. In the court opinion for this case, Chief Justice Waite argued that although Congress alone could regulate interstate commerce, the regulations in question in this case did not impair federal control, and agreed that a \"virtual monopoly\" was created by the owners of grain elevators.
