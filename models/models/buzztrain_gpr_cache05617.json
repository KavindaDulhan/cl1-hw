  "His opus one is a single-movement piano concerto in F-sharp minor. Songs by this composer include the \"Song of Selim\" and a work that would later be adapted as this composer's Scherzo No.3, the \"Song of the Golden Fish.\" He gave the title 1000 Years to the second of his two overtures that he referred to as \"a musical picture,\" and works inspired by Spain include the Fandango-etude for piano and the orchestral Overture on a Spanish March Theme. The second of his two second symphonies features a Scherzo alla cosacca, or Cossack scherzo, and he composed incidental music for King Lear. A symphonic poem about a beautiful but evil princess was inspired by the poetry of Lermontov, while his first successes including an orchestration of the The Lark and a Piano Fantasia on Life for the Tsar were based on the work of his predecessor and inspiration, Glinka.
