  "The potential error when modelling these systems is given on a zero to nine scale in the U parameter. These systems can be periodically modulated on the order of ten to the negative 5th by activity cycles in the Applegate mechanism. \"Halo\" ones tend to be unstable, requiring station-keeping to maintain them. Calculations for moving between two of these often uses the patched conic approximation. Because angular momentum is conserved for forces solely dependent on the direction of motion, these systems exhibit motion only in the (*) plane. The vis viva equation is used to calculate the velocity of participants in these. The only stable closed type of these constructs are formed through central forces that are either linear or inverse square in position, and they are elliptical in Kepler's two-body": {
