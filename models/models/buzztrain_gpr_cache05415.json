  "The occurrence of this phenomenon with respect to the earth results in the Milankovitch cycles, and a (*) relativistic form of this phenomenon results from the noncommutativity of infinitesimal Lorentz transformations. A more common form of this phenomenon is exploited in such techniques as NMR and has a frequency given by the product of the gyromagnetic ration and the applied magnetic field. It is the term given to the tumbling of an object about an unstable Euler axis, and when applied to a top subject to a torque, it is given by the time-dependence of one of the Euler angles.
