  "In Books 4 and 7 of his Guide to Greece, Pausanias describes how no soldiers from the Peloponnesus took part in a battle at this site, resulting in one side being outnumbered by over four to one. The tide turned when the enemy divided forces and the general Acichorios marched into Aetolia to sack the city of Callium. The opening salvos saw the Greeks burn bridges over the Spercheios River, which the enemy nevertheless forded. Loss was sealed when the Greeks under Callippus were flanked by a detachment led by Brennus using a familiar path over Mount Oeta. That battle led to an attack on Delphi by the Gauls in 279 BC, while another battle here saw Antiochus III lose to the Romans under Manius Glabrio in 191 BC. Still another battle here happened simultaneously with the naval Battle of Artemisium, and saw the \"Immortals\" commanded by Hydarnes. FTP, name this site where Leonidas made his stand": {

  "A book titled after this work's \"unfinished semantic agenda\" covers \"Ambiguity and Indexicality\" and \"Millian Meaning and Pseudo-Fregean Attitudes\" and was written by Scott Soames. Joseph Almog plays on this work's title in a paper that denounces a \"strong\" and \"weak\" distinction that this work draws, required by a specific \"modal orientation\" of a concept from this work. That Almog work claims linguistic arguments might be more suitable, complaining that \"the offspring of gametes G\" is the \"syntactic ally\" of \"the president involved in the Watergate affair.\" The third part of this work examines the mind-body problem and natural kinds, and its second part discusses the \"cluster theory\" of names. This work is a compilation of three lectures given at Princeton in 1970. To replace Russell's theory of definite descriptions, this work develops the idea of phrases that mean the same thing in all possible worlds.

The jambs and lintel zone of this building's central portal feature sculptures of the Wise and Foolish Virgins and two Atlantids. Golden axes in a circle once surrounded the altar of the throne, which joins the marble ciborium amongst the lost work Eligius did for this building.

Another work that discusses \"emotions\" and this concept appeared after its author's The Senses and the Intellect, and was written by Alexander Bain.  The title of Martin Luther's 1525 response to an attack by Erasmus refers to the \"bondage\" of this concept.  Another work whose title mentions this concept was published posthumously after being edited in part by Elisabeth F\u00f6rster. The author of that work had earlier discussed a form of this concept directed towards \"truth.\"  Another thinker associated this concept with the subjective aspect of things, and characterized it as a striving, non-rational, and blind impulse in an 1819 work.
