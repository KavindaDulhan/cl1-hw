Compadrazgo is an example of the fictive kind of this concept. Six patterns of this concept were described by Lewis Henry Morgan, including the \"generational\" Hawaiian system and the \"bifurcate merging\" Iroquois type. The cognatic form of tracking this concept is divided into bilateral or ambilinial types.

  "In 1697, David Gregory wrote a comprehensive treatise on this shape, and a challenge in Acta Eruditorum to find its equation prompted solutions from Huygens (HOY-gunz), Leibniz, and Johann Bernoulli. Euler (OY-lur) proved that this shape produces the surface of revolution with minimum area, while a road pitted with a continuous series of these curves will allow a square wheel to roll smoothly. This curve is traced by the focus of a parabola as it rolls along a straight line, and it is asymptotic to graphs of both exponential growth and exponential decay. Because it eliminates shear forces at joints and causes weight to be directed down into the ground rather than at an angle, Robert Hooke determined that this is the optimal shape of an arch.
