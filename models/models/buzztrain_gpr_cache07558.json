Its translator and author were likely from the same region. This translator of this work argued that its mingling of (*) time- frames was an intentional commentary on its main theme: the inevitability of death, and that its ambiguous religious setting was a consequence of ongoing Christianization when it was written as opposed to when it is set. Those statements about it appear in this translator's essay on this work subtitled \"The Monsters and the Critics.\" For 10 points, name this recently-published translation of an Old English epic poem about a Geatish warrior-king by the author of Lord of the Rings.": {

Its translator and author were likely from the same region. This translator of this work argued that its mingling of (*) time- frames was an intentional commentary on its main theme: the inevitability of death, and that its ambiguous religious setting was a consequence of ongoing Christianization when it was written as opposed to when it is set.
