Another came at Oberglau where Holstein-Beck was repulsed by de Blainville.

  "The pretext for this conflict was a so-called Farmer's Rebellion which was inspired by a religious movement known as the Eastern Learning.  That rebellion took off following a meeting at Boeun, where the Donghaks gathered to protest oppression.  Six months after it ended, the last empress of a nation neighboring one of the powers involved in this war was assassinated at the behest of Miura Goro.  The end of this conflict also signaled the end of the Self-Strengthening Movement in the defeated country, and the peace concluding it required the defeated party to open four additional ports to international commerce. The indemnity required by the victors consumed almost 80% of the loser's annual tax collection of 250 million Taels, while territorial losses included the Pescadores Islands.
