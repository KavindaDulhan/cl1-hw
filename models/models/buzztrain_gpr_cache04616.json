  "The machine used in this experiment can be represented as a projection operator into orthogonal subspaces. Usually modeled using electrons, the original experiment actually used silver atoms, and later ones verified it with hydrogen atoms. Though one of the simplest quantum systems, with only two states, it was nonetheless critical to the development of quantum mechanics, demonstrating the nature of measurement as a process that fundamentally altered the system.
