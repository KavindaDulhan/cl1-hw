  "One of them is a fat old man who wears a green robe and waves a fan made out of feathers to soothe the ocean.  Another of them is a patron of gardeners who was once carried to the heavens by a stork, which caused him to drop his wooden belt and single shoe.  Another of them lost his body when a servant prematurely cremated it, after which his soul was put into the body of a beggar who had died of hunger.  Yet another of them is a god of barbers who always bears a sword, rides a donkey backwards, and wrote the Hundred Character Tablet.  The only female of them is also known as Kasenko, and is usually accompanied by a judge.   Two of them began as ordinary humans, but were granted eternal life by the gods.

  "Faur\u00e9's Opus 24 is an Elegy featuring this instrument. Schumann wrote Five Pieces in Folk Style for this instrument and piano. Saint-Sa\u00ebns's first concerto for this instrument is in A minor and in one movement. This instrument plays the opening theme of the first movement of Dvorak's piano quintet and Mendelssohn's first piano trio. Late in his life, (*) Schumann wrote a one-movement concerto for this non-piano instrument in A minor. This instrument is the soloist in Bloch's Schelomo, Bruch's Kol Nidrei, and Strauss's Don Quixote. This is the lower instrument featured in Brahms's Double Concerto,": {
