  "CAAX is a recognition motif for an enzyme that adds this type of molecule to Ras and other proteins.  The cyclization of these compounds involves enzymes with an \"aspartate-rich\" DXXDD motif that produce intermediates like bornyl diphosphate.  Biosynthesis of some of these compounds, such as artemesinin, takes place in specialized secretory structures like glandular trichomes, where a plastidial type of synthesis is employed.  Enzymes important in their production include DXR and HMGR, and these compounds are derived from two isomeric precursors, IPP and DMAPP, which can be generated from either 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate or mevalonic acid.  Examples of this class of compounds include": {
