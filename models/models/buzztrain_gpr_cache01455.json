One side in this battle notably made a tactical mistake by choosing very small ground and thus forfeiting their considerable advantage of numbers, and it later proved to be more deadly as their heavily armored knights were fodder for lightly armed archers. Charles de l'Albert on the French side of this conflict was blamed for their tactical stupidity, and that side lost about 5,000 men.
