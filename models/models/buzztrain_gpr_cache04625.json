Another novel by this author contains a hairdresser with two personalities, known alternately as Peter Schoenfeld and Pietro Bellocampo, who tries to save the monk Medardus from the title substance. This author of The Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr  and The Devil's Elixirs, also wrote a story in which one character screams, \"Pretty eyes!

A generalized version of the physical result of this name can be derived for non-Hamiltonian systems by introducing a metric factor. A more specific mathematical result of this name states that a bounded, entire function in the complex plane is constant and has the fundamental theorem of algebra as a corollary, and is unrelated to the physical result. That physical theorem states that in a Hamiltonian system, the phase space density is conserved.

  "This mathematician names a surface in spacetime which intersects every non-spacelike curve in that spacetime exactly once, and a value named for him appears in the Kramers\u0096Kronig relations. A weaker form of Sylow's first theorem is his theorem which states that if a prime number p divides the order of G, then G has a subgroup of order p. He names a theorem stating that the integral of a function on a simply connected region is equal to the sum of the function's a sub negative one Laurent coefficients at each pole in the region. Any complex differentiable function will satisfy the pair of differential equations named for him and Riemann, and he is the first namesake of an inequality on vector spaces.
