  "A shadow on the left side of this painting is depicted out of proportion leading some scholars to believe it is actually a reflection of the tavern The Parrot. In the background an arsenal called The Armamentarium is seen, while a clock on the Kethel Gatehouse reveals the time is 7 am. A towing barge appears next to three burghers in the left foreground in a non-functional position from which it would be impossible to embark. In this painting surprisingly the bell tower of the New Church is empty. On the right side of this painting a double drawbridge appears next to the Rotterdam Gate, which is one of many buildings reflecting in the water of the Schie Canal. For 10 points, name this painting of a Dutch city by Jan Vermeer.": {
