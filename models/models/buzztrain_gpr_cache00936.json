  "One of the more climactic scenes is that of the campaign to avenge the death of Sweno. Early on we see, due to the urging of Ismeno, Aladine hatch a plan that is thwarted by someone unknown but for which Olindo and Sophronia are briefly blamed. The turning point is a vision in which the Frenchman Hugh advises for the recall of a banished hero. Two of the more valiant enemies are Argantes and the female warrior Clorinda, both of whom are killed by the mighty Tancred.

  "Clifford Shull used the neutron type of this concept to explore the structure of ice, and one model of this concept uses Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integrals. Used to explain an opal's play-of-color, the Laue (LOUW-uh) patterns produced by this effect on X-rays helped determine the shape of DNA. An Airy disk results when this principle occurs for a circular aperture, and Fresnel numbers less than one are indicative of its Fraunhofer (FROUN-hoh-fer) type. Generating interference patterns in Young's double-slit experiment, name this principle, the bending or spreading of waves around an obstacle.": {
