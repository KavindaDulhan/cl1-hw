  "This speech suggests that \"defeats in which nobody loses anything of value\" result from filling one's \"workshop\" with \"anything but the old verities and truths of the heart.\" A speech quoting and updating this one, but given by a different orator, opens by noting how Antonio Pigafetta found \"tongueless pelicans\" and \"clawless birds\" in Latin America. This speech praises the focus of \"young men and women\" who toil in the \"agony and sweat of the human spirit\" to \"create something which did not exist before.\" It mocks those who think that the presence of a \"puny inexhaustible voice, still talking\" after the \"last dingdong of (*) doom has clanged\" suggests that man is immortal, instead saying \"I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail,\" despite the threat of nuclear war. Gabriel Garcia Marquez quoted this speech on the same occasion thirty-two years later, appropriately given that this speech's author helped inspire the town of Macondo. For 10 points, name this 1949 speech, addressed to young writers, given in Stockholm by the recently recognized author of The Sound and the Fury.": {
