  "The Bodroux reaction forms them from a Grignard reagent, an aniline derivative, and a carboxylic acid, and the Beckmann rearrangement produces cyclic ones, called lactams, from oximes. Their IR shift is the furthest downfield of any saturated carbonyl, between 1630 and 1695, reflecting the fact that they are the least reactive derivative. a This term is sometimes used to describe deprotonated ammonia, and peptide bonds are also called these linkages. FTP, identify this functional group, which may be described as an amine with an acyl group for one substituent, or as a nitrogen analogue of carboxylic acids.": {
