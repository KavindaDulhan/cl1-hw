  "The use of these over finite fields for a type of public-key cryptography was proposed by Koblitz and Miller. Adding a point at infinity allows one to define a group operation that maps two points on it to a third point on it such that all three points are collinear. It discriminant, proportional to 4 A cubed plus 27 B squared when its equation is y squared equals x cubed plus A x plus B, is zero when it is singular. Topologically, it is equivalent to a torus. A conjecture relating them to modular forms was proven in part by Andrew Wiles as part of his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. For 10 points, what is this type of algebraic curve, of which the similarly-named conic section that looks like a squashed circle is not an example?": {
