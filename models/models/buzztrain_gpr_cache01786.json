  "The equilibria associated with this concept has a constant denoted Ksp, and this property can be calculated with the Ksp and an ICE table. The common- ion effect reduces the extent of this property. The formation of complexes greatly increases this property with certain metal ions, such as with silver ions in the presence of ammonia.

Sorenson's experiments on ionic interactions among amino acids led him to conclude that the concentration of hydrogen ions at any particular time could be mathematically derived. This led one of this equation's formulators to conclude that the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant, when added to the ratio of dissociated acid to the non- dissociated acid, would yield the pH.
