  "Felson and Cohen developed the rational activity theory to describe this behavior, while Robert Reiner argued that it occurs due to narcissism. Park and Burgess showed that this behavior most often occurs at zones of transitions, and Edwin Sutherland's study of this behavior lead to the Differential Association Theory. Leavitt and Donohue argued for an inverse correlation in the rates of legalized abortion and this behavior, and another theory states that structural and individual pressures lead to this behavior, which is a result of anomie; that idea, popularized by Merton, is strain theory. Another work that studied this behavior famously opposed the death penalty and outlined the idea of deterrence.": {
