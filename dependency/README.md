This homework is about dependency parsing.  We'll create a classifier to create a shift-reduce parser.


Big Picture
===========

The goal of this homework is to create a dependency parser.  This will be in two stages: first to create training data (an oracle sequence of transitions), and then to train a classifier to produce the same sequence of transitions.

Evaluating the classifier is a bit tricky because the errors are not independent.  If you make a mistake on one word, it will affect the ability to correctly parse the rest of the sentence.  We'll use two metrics: classification accuracy (how often the classifier chooses the correct action given all previous actions were correct, similar to teacher forcing we discussed for LLM decoding) and attachment accuracy (how often the classifier chooses the correct parent for a word, which is extra credit).

Data
===========

First, we’ll need some dependency parsed sentences.  NLTK has a small dataset available:


    >>> from nltk.corpus import dependency_treebank
    >>> s = dependency_treebank.parsed_sents()[0]
    >>> for ii in s.to_conll(4).split("\n"): print(ii)
    ...

What to do
============

0.  Read the code and understand it.  This includes both the `dependency.py` file and the `test_dependency.py` file.

0. Implement the stack and buffer operations in the class `ShiftReduceState`.  You will need to implement three functions (one for each action type): `shift`, `right_arc`, and `left_arc`.

1. Given a DependencyGraph object, create a method (`transition_sequence`) that
produces a series of shift-reduce moves (instances of the `Transition` object)
that produces the tree.  

2. Given a series of shift-reduce moves (as generated by `transition_sequence`) and an input sentence (the words and tags), produce the DependencyGraph by implementing the function `parse_from_transition`.  

3. You'll train a classifier to produce the same transitions.  The first step is to generate feature vectors for your transitions.  Start with something simple!

4. Given a set of transitions, train a MaxEnt classifier to produce the same moves using the feature set.  (Use “IIS” first for the algorithm - I had trouble with others.)  This code is given to you, you'll just need to get the feature set for it.

What constitutes a "good enough" implementation?
===========================================

Your oracle transition sequence should be correct.  You should be able to reconstruct the dependency tree from the transition sequence for any projective tree in the dataset. [10 points]

While it's possible to get over 85% accuracy on the test data, you just need to get over 75% to get full credit.  (It might be possible to get above that with more feature engineering.)  [10 points]

What does a good implementation look like?
===========================================

When you run the code, you should see something like this.  It will first print the sentence, then the oracle transitions.  After that it will train the classifier and print out the accuracy.

What to turn in
===============

Submit your code on Gradescope.  Provide a brief writeup explaining your feature engineering.

Extra Credit
===============

1.  [Up to 5 points] Do feature engineering to further improve the accuracy.  (You cannot change the classifier or dataset.)

2.  [Up to 5 points] Complete the code to compute attachment accuracy.  This requires three things: implement the `attachment_accuracy` function, implement the `sentence_attachment_accuracy` function, and use the `classifier_transition_sequence` function to generate the transitions from the classifier.  You might need to harden some code elsewhere to account for impossible / incomplete transitions.

3.  [Up to 5 points] Do an error analysis to understand what the classifier is getting wrong.  What types of transitions does it mispredict (i.e., what kinds of situations does it get confused by)?  

4.  [Up to 5 points] Implement the [RULES baseline](https://aclanthology.org/W12-1910.pdf) via the function `heuristic_transition_sequence` and report its accuracy on this dataset.


FAQ
========

*Q: Why do I not see the transition sequence?*
*A:* Initially, the `transition_sequence` function returns an empty iterator.  You need to implement the function to generate the sequence.

*Q: Why do I get a division by zero error when I train the classifier?*
*A:* Because the `transition_sequence` function is returning an empty iterator, there are no features to train on.
